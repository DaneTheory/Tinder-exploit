# Tinder has modified their API to limit recommendation calls. This tool should still work, but with limited effictiveness :'(

# Tinder Crawler (From 2015)
Node.js app that uses the private Tinder API to fake authentication, spoof app location, and then crawl/download all profiles in the vicinity. 


[![Maintenance Intended](http://maintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://maintained.tech/)

## Instructions

Get your Facebook ID from Facebook

* Put it into the authentication script before starting the application

Get your Facebook ID

* Visit `https://www.facebook.com/dialog/oauth?client_id=464891386855067&redirect_uri=https://www.facebook.com/connect/login_success.html&scope=basic_info,email,public_profile,user_about_me,user_activities,user_birthday,user_education_history,user_friends,user_interests,user_likes,user_location,user_photos,user_relationship_details&response_type=token`
* Copy the URL immediately after getting to the site
* You will need it when you are prompted by the application

Figure out the coordinates of where you'd like to strike

* Pos/neg decimal coordinates rounded to the nearest integer
* You will need it when you are prompted by the application

## Finding specific position

Stick the data into a triangulation algorithim and you can get the specific location of any user that has been crawled upon.

## Is this legal?

I think so.

## Sample data

Sample data that should be returned are included in this repo.

## Installation

```
npm install
npm start
```
