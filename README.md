# Tinder has modified their API to limit recommendation calls. This tool should still work, but with limited effictiveness :'(

# Tinder Crawler (From 2015)
Node.js app that uses the private Tinder API to fake authentication, spoof app location, and then crawl/download all profiles in the vicinity. 


[![Maintenance Intended](http://maintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://maintained.tech/)

## Instructions

Get your Facebook ID from Facebook

* Put it into the authentication script before starting the application

Get your Facebook ID

* Visit `https://www.facebook.com/v2.6/dialog/oauth?redirect_uri=fb464891386855067%3A%2F%2Fauthorize%2F&display=touch&state=%7B%22challenge%22%3A%22IUUkEUqIGud332lfu%252BMJhxL4Wlc%253D%22%2C%220_auth_logger_id%22%3A%2230F06532-A1B9-4B10-BB28-B29956C71AB1%22%2C%22com.facebook.sdk_client_state%22%3Atrue%2C%223_method%22%3A%22sfvc_auth%22%7D&scope=user_birthday%2Cuser_photos%2Cuser_education_history%2Cemail%2Cuser_relationship_details%2Cuser_friends%2Cuser_work_history%2Cuser_likes&response_type=token%2Csigned_request&default_audience=friends&return_scopes=true&auth_type=rerequest&client_id=464891386855067&ret=login&sdk=ios&logger_id=30F06532-A1B9-4B10-BB28-B29956C71AB1&ext=1470840777&hash=AeZqkIcf-NEW6vBd`
* View your network requests (on chrome open developer tools and click on the network tab)
* Click the ok button on the Facebook pop-up window.
* In your network request history, there should be a new request called confirm?dpr=1 
* View the body of the response. Copy the text between access_token= and &expires_in=4011.
* You'll need that for authentication

Figure out the coordinates of where you'd like to strike

* Pos/neg decimal coordinates rounded to the nearest integer
* You will need it when you are prompted by the application

## Finding specific position

Stick the data into a triangulation algorithim and you can get the specific location of any user that has been crawled upon.

## Is this legal?

I think so.

## Sample data

Sample data that should be returned are included in this repo.

## Installation

```
npm install
npm start
```
